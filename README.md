# CIDRe
Developement of a new data reduction approach for data in geosciences. The resampling result is always an irregular point distribution based on the given data. A higher point density is ensured in spatial areas with high variations in the data parameters. A preliminary code example is submitted with the associated GEOPHYSICS publication. A Matlab-based GUI-softare is also available (ask P. Menzel). The software is not under further developement. This may change in future.
